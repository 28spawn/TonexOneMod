# Tonex One Controller: An open-source controller and display interface for the IK Multimedia Tonex One guitar pedal
This project uses a low-cost embedded controller (Espressif ESP32-S3) to form a bridge to the IK Multimedia Tonex One guitar pedal (which does not have native Midi capability.)
<br>It allows selection of the 20 different presets in the pedal, by any or all of touch screen, wired footswitches, bluetooth footswitches, bluetooth servers, and midi programs.
<br>A variety of hardware is supported, from a $6 board with no display, up to a $44 board with a 4.3" touch screen LCD and a pretty graphical user interface.

## Meet the Family <a name="meet_family"></a>
This project can run on any of three different hardware platforms, varying in size and cost. All of them are "off-the-shelf" development boards supplied by the company "Waveshare."
The code could be adapted to run on other brand ESP32-S3 boards, but to make things easy, pre-built releases are provided for the Waveshare modules.
<br>All platforms support Bluetooth, WiFi, wired footswitches, and wired Midi.
- 4.3" LCD board, supporting touch screen and advanced graphics including customisable amp/pedal skins and text
- 1.69" LCD board. Similar to an Apple Watch, this small board displays the preset name and number
- "Zero" board with no display, is the smallest and cheapest option

## ‚≠ê¬†Key Features <a name="key_features"></a>
The supported features vary a little depending on the chosen hardware platform.
- LCD display with capactive touch screen ("4.3B" model)
- LCD display ("1.69" model)
- Screen displays the name and number of the current preset ("4.3B" and "1.69" models.)
- The User can select an amplifier or pedal skin and also add descriptive text ("4.3B" model)
- Use of simple dual footswitches to select next/previous preset
- Bluetooth Client support. Use of the "M-Vave Chocolate" bluetooth Midi footswitch device to switch presets (4 buttons, bank up/down)
- Other Bluetooth Midi controllers should be fairly easy to support with code changes, provided they use the standard Bletooth Midi service and characteristic
- Bluetooth server support. Pair your phone/tablet with the controller, and send standard Midi program changes, bridged through to the Tonex One pedal (note Server and Client cannot be used simultaneously)
- USB host control of the Tonex pedal
- Wired/Serial Midi support

## Hardware Platforms and Wiring <a name="hardware_platforms"></a>
For more information about the hardware platforms, refer to [Hardware Platforms](HardwarePlatforms.md)

## Uploading/Programming Firmware Releases <a name="firmware_uploading"></a>
For more information about uploading firmware to the boards, refer to [Firmware Uploading](FirmwareUploading.md)

## Configuration and Settings <a name="config"></a>
For more information about changing configuration and settings, for example to change the Midi channel, refer to [Web Configuration](WebConfiguration.md)

## Usage Instructions <a name="usage_instructions"></a>
### Hardware platform with Display
- Connect power
- After a few seconds of boot time, the LCD display should now show the description for your current Preset
- Change presets using one or more of the following methods
  1. Touch screen Next/Previous labels
  2. Dual footswitchs for next/previous preset
  3. Bluetooth Client mode: M-Vave Chocolate footswitches. Bank 1 does presets 1,2,3,4. Bank 2 does presets 5,6,7,8. Etc.
  4. Bluetooth Server mode: Bluetooth Midi controller to send Program change messages 0 to 19
- The Amplifier skin image is not stored in the Tonex One Pedal, hence this needs to be manually selected
- To select an Amp skin and/or change the description text
  1. Press and hold the Preset name for a few seconds
  2. Navigation arrows will appear next to the amp skin image
  3. Use the left/right arrows to navigate through the available amp skins
  4. Press the description text. A keyboard will appear, allowing text to be entered
  5. Press the green tick image to save the changes. Changes will be saved permanently and remembered when next powered on
 
### Hardware platform without Display
- Connect power
- Change presets using one or more of the following methods
  1. Bluetooth Client mode: M-Vave Chocolate footswitches. Bank 1 does presets 1,2,3,4. Bank 2 does presets 5,6,7,8. Etc.
  2. Bluetooth Server mode: Bluetooth Midi controller to send Program change messages 0 to 19
